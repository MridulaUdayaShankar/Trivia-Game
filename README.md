# Project title: Trivia-Game

## Getting Started

This is a project to build Crystals Collector game, where the player will randomly guess numbers hidden behind 4 crystals to sum up to a number the computer has chosen at the start of the game.

### Pre-requisites

* This is a Trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

* If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. 
* After a few seconds, display the next question without user input.

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

* If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

* If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

* On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
